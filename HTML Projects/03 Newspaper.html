  <body>
    <p>  German prosecutors said today that they had dropped an investigation into accusations that top managers of Daimler-Benz A.G. deliberately misled investors about the company's financial condition in 1995.<br>

   

''The investigation did not confirm the accusation of deliberate false presentation of the financial condition of the company,'' the Stuttgart prosecutor's office said.

The charges were filed by a shareholder against the company's former chief executive, Edzard Reuter; the current chief executive, Jurgen Schrempp, and the chief financial officer, Manfred Gentz. Hilmar Kopper, chairman of Daimler's supervisory board and chief executive of Deutsche Bank, was also accused.

The managers were accused of deliberately misleading shareholders by predicting the company would make a profit in 1995. Instead Daimler reported a loss of 5.7 billion marks, or $3.7 billion.</p>
